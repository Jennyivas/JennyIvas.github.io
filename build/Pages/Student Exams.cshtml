<p class="text">For students who want to follow a graded exam system, Jenny submits students for examinations with the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) if they wish. This consists of up to 8 graded practical exams and optional music theory exams (in order to proceed to grade 6 onwards in practical exams, you must pass the grade 5 theory exam). </p><br />

<p class="text">The practical exams take 12 minutes, with tests getting longer after grade 4. The test is marked using 4 major criteria: </p><br />
<li><b>performances</b> - three pieces chosen by the ABRSM <i>(90 marks)</font></i> </li>
<li><b>scales</b> - <i>(21 marks)</i></li>
<li><b>sight reading</b> - <i>(21 marks)</i></li>
<li><b>aural tests</b> - <i>(18 marks)</i></li>
<br />
<p class="text">Each year, there are three opportunities to enter for exams: the spring term, summer term and autumn term. <b>For a full list of exam dates and fees, <a href=http://gb.abrsm.org/en/exam-booking/exam-dates-and-fees/ target=�_blank�>click here</a></b></p><br />

<p class="text">For musicians who wish to sit a grade 6 practical exam, they must first pass not only the grade 5 practical exam but also pass the grade 5 theory exam. Theory exams are designed to supply musicians with an understanding of the fundaments of music. You do not need to have sat music theory grades 1-4 before sitting the grade 5 theory test.</p><br />
<p class="text">The exam is marked out of 100 and will question students on their knowledge of key musical techniques such as harmony, melody, rhythm, dynamics and other frequently used music markings.</p><br />
<p class="text">You can find out more about practical music exams and music theory exams on the ABRSM official website.</p>
