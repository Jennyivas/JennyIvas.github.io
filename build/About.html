            <br />
            <p class="text">I teach all ages from young to old not only piano, but other musical skills such as harmony and aural training. I get on well with people, relating to youngsters as well as adults, and feel I am a patient teacher and encourage parents of young students to sit in on lessons if both parent and student are happy to do so. I teach things thoroughly and work at a pace suitable for each individual.</p>
            <p class="text">With over 20 years experience of private teaching I embrace a varied musical diet such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Queen, Billy Joel, Scott Joplin, Frank Sinatra, Adele etc. and offer support with the music GCSE and A level syllabus. For Academic music GCSE and A level work, a lot of the work is practically based. So, as a piano tutor, I am always willing to play a role in teaching and developing piano work for their exams, whether it be an integral role such as choosing and teaching music or playing the second part of a piano duet, or a backseat role like simply giving opinions or advice when asked. </p>
            <p class="text">I currently use the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) for students who wish to sit exams, though not everyone wants to take exams and thats fine. I have an excellent success rate with the ABRSM but I believe it is more important to maintain a good balance between students enjoying playing piano and building their own repertoire and then sitting exams when they wish. </p>
            <p class="text">Some of my past students have gone on to make successful careers out of music: one ex-student became the guitarist for Errol Browns group <i>Hot Chocolate </i>, and another is playing as a session musician with a number of bands ranging from jazz to two-tone to heavy metal, all while comfortably playing renditions of Mozart and Chopin music. Another ex-student of mine has gone on to specialise in composition and is currently working tirelessly for the opportunity to have his work published. The majority of my ex-students do continue playing for fun after their lessons have ended even if they do not wish to pursue musical careers. I try to keep in touch with my former students and will always offer to lend them a hand should they ever need it again. </p>
