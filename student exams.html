<h2> Student Exams </h2></center>
<h4><center><i>Since the year 2000, Jenny as had a 99% pass rate with 39 merits and 26 distinctions. </i></center></h4>
<h4>For students who want to follow a graded exam system, Jenny submits students for examinations with the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) if they wish. This consists of up to 8 graded practical exams and optional music theory exams (in order to proceed to grade 6 onwards in practical exams, you must pass the grade 5 theory exam). </h4>
<h4>The practical exams take 12 minutes, with tests getting longer after grade 4. When a student sits an exam, they are scored out of 150. The test is marked using 4 major criteria: </h4>
<li><b>performances</b> <font style="font-variant:none;font-size:0.9em;">three pieces chosen by the ABRSM <i>(90 marks)</font></i> </li>
<li><b>scales</b> <font style="font-variant:none;font-size:0.9em;"><i>(21 marks)</font></i></li>
<li><b>sight reading</b> <font style="font-variant:none;font-size:0.9em;"><i>(21 marks)</font></i></li>
<li><b>aural tests</b> <font style="font-variant:none;font-size:0.9em;"><i>(18 marks)</font></i></li>
<h4>In order to pass, you must score at least 100/150. The boundaries are given in full below:</h4>
<li><b>pass</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;"><i>(100/150)</font></i></li>
<li><b>merit</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;"><i>(120/150)</font></i></li>
<li><b>distinction</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;"><i>(130/150)</font></i></li>

<center><h2 id=”theory”>Music Theory Exams</h2></center>
<h4>Alongside practical music exams, students can choose to sit additional music theory exams designed to apply them with the knowledge and understanding of the fundaments of music which musicians rely on daily. For musicians who wish to sit a grade 6 practical exam, they must first pass not only the grade 5 practical exam, but they must also pass the grade 5 theory exam. However, you do not need to have sat music theory grades 1-4 before sitting the grade 5 theory test.</h4>
<h4>The Music theory test is a written exam and will question students on their knowledge of key musical techniques such as harmony, melody, rhythm, dynamics and other frequently used music markings. The grade 1 theory paper consists of fundamental material which students will have already come across during their studies and in preparation for their exams:</h4>
<li><b>note values</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">Semibreve, minim, crotchet, quaver and semiquaver, and their equivalent rests. Tied notes. Single-dotted notes and rests. </font></li>
<li><b>simple time signatures</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">(2/4, 3/4 and 4/4), bar-lines, how notes are written for these different times. Composition of a two-bar rhythm in continuation of an already given rhythm. </font></li>
<li><b>the stave:</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">Treble (G) and bass (F) clefs. Names of notes on the stave, including middle C in both clefs. Sharp, flat and natural signs, and their cancellation. </font></li>
<li><b>the major scale</b>, <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">How the major scale is built (in tones and semi-tones).  Scales and key signatures of the major keys of C, G, D and F in both clefs, with their tonic chords, degrees and intervals above the tonic (by number only). </font></li>
<li><b>common signs and markings</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">concerning tempo, dynamics, performance directions and articulation marks. Simple questions will be asked about a melody written in either treble or bass clef. </font></li>
<h4>The test paper is marked out of 100, with grade boundaries for pass, merit and distinction as follows:</h4>
<li><b>pass</b><font style="font-size:0.9em;"><i> (66/100)</font></i></li>
<li><b>merit</b><font style="font-size:0.9em;"><i> (80/100)</font></i></li>
<li><b>distinction</b><font style="font-size:0.9em;"><i> (90/100)</font></i></li>
<h4>For students hoping to sit the grade 5 theory exam, the grade boundaries remain the same. The exam syllabus includes all the material covered in the previous exams with the addition of the following:</h4>
<li><b>irregular time signatures</b>  <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">of 5/4, 7/4, 5/8, 7/8 and the grouping of notes and rests within these times. Irregular divisions of simple time values.</font></li>
<li><b>tenor clef</b>  <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">(C clef centred on 4th line). The identification of notes in the four clefs in any of the keys set for this grade, and the transposition at the octave of a simple melody from any clef to another. The writing at concert pitch of a melody notated for an instrument in Bb, A or F, and vice versa. The writing in open score of a passage for SATB written on two staves, and vice versa. </font></li>
<li><b>scales and key signatures</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">of all major and minor keys up to and including six sharps and flats. All simple and compound intervals from any note. The identification of the 5-3, 6-3 and 6-4 forms of the tonic, supertonic, subdominant and dominant chords in any of the keys set for this grade. The identification of the progression 6-4, 5-3 (Ic-V) on the dominant note in any of the keys set for this grade. The choice of suitable chords, using any recognized method of notation, at cadential points of a simple melody in the major key of C, G, D or F. </font></li>
<li><b>the composition of a simple melody</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">of no more than eight bars, using a given opening and writing for a specific instrument or the composition of a melody to given words. Appropriate performing directions relating to tempo, dynamics and articulation will be required. </font></li>
<li><b>more terms and signs</b> <font style="font-size:0.9em;font-variant:none;letter-spacing:2px;">The recognition of ornaments, including the replacement of written-out ornamentation with the appropriate signs, but not vice versa. Questions about a passage of music written for voices or instruments appropriate to the grade will include questions on the types of voice and names of instruments, the clefs they use, instrument family groups and the basic way by which they produce sound, as well as points of general musical observation designed to test the candidates ability to apply theoretical knowledge to actual music. </font></li>
