            <p class="text">Jenny Ivas has decades of experience in playing music and piano tuition, accumulating a varied musical diet ranging from classical composers such as Mozart and Beethoven to contemporary music by the likes of Sinatra, Queen and more. 
              Her students range across many different age groups and aspiration levels, working at the speed and intensity best suited to each individual pupil. 
              She has exceptional knowledge in not only playing music, but understanding it; alongside teaching students how to play and read music, she can help students understand music theory, an important aspect of music which is needed in both the GCSE and A level exam curricula.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="text">Jenny submits students for examinations with the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) for those who wish. 
             This prestigious music exam consists of performing three selected pieces, showing technical abilities on the piano and answering questions about music theory. 
              Jenny has an incredible 100% pass rate since 2002 and has taken students through all grade levels. 
              However, none of her students are forced to sit exams and any student may take lessons simply for the enjoyment of playing.</p>
            <br />
