		<comment>I have known Jenny for 20 years as my piano teacher and she is simply amazing. She has so much knowledge about music in general and can convey her knowledge in a down-to-earth manner. I would highly recommend her for all ages and any skill level.</comment>

		<comment>Jenny is a very kind &#38; patient teacher and always likes to praise rather than criticise. She can be firm where needed but always encouraging. In short my daughter loves her lessons so what more can I ask for!</comment>
