<h4>Jenny Ivas has decades of experience in music and piano tuition, accumulating a varied musical diet ranging from classical composers such as Mozart and Beethoven to contemporary music by the likes of Sinatra, Queen and more. She has exceptional knowledge in not only playing, but other important aspects of music which are needed in GCSE and A level exam curricula with which she is also able to help her students.</h4>
<h4>Jenny submits students for examinations with the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) for those who wish. Jenny as had an incredible 100% pass rate since 2002. However, none of the students are forced to sit exams and any student may take lessons simply for the enjoyment of playing. Her students range across people of many different ages and aspirations and she works at the speed and intensity best suited to each individual pupil.</h4>
