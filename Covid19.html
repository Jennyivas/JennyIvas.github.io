<center><h2>Resuming Lessons after the Coronavirus Lockdown</h2></center>
<h4>I intend to start giving piano lessons again as of Monday July 6th for those students who are happy to attend. As always, I am committed to providing a clean, safe and comfortable environment for all my clients and, due to the situation with the Coronavirus, I will be putting some new measures into place for everyone’s safety.</h4>
<h4>I will be wearing a face mask whilst teaching and would ask that my students do the same please. Once seated at the piano, before touching the piano keys, I will ask all of my students to cleanse their hands with sanitizer that I will provide; equally, I will sanitize my hands in between each lesson. The piano keys will be cleaned with anti-bacterial wipes after each lesson. For anyone needing to use the bathroom, disposable paper towels will be available in said room.</h4>
<h4>If I feel a slight cough, cold, flu, temperature, stomach bug/virus coming on (excluding hay fever) or if I am just recovering from the worst of one of these mentioned ailments I will cancel my lessons so as not to come into close contact with any of my students. I would ask all of my students to do the same please. Any sign of a slight bug/virus, cold, cough or such like, please text or phone me to cancel your lesson.</h4>
<h4>I hope everyone will understand that I’m adding these extra measures in order to ensure as safe and healthy a teaching environment as possible for all concerned and thank you for your co-operation. </h4>
